    /// source. If `n` is `0`, then it can indicate one of two scenarios:
    ///
    /// 1. This reader has reached its "end of file" and will likely no longer
    ///    be able to produce bytes. Note that this does not mean that the
    ///    reader will *always* no longer be able to produce bytes.
    /// 2. The buffer specified was 0 bytes in length.
    ///
    /// No guarantees are provided about the contents of `buf` when this
    /// function is called, implementations cannot rely on any property of the
    /// contents of `buf` being true. It is recommended that *implementations*
    /// only write data to `buf` instead of reading its contents.

    /// Correspondingly, however, *callers* of this method may not assume any guarantees
    /// about how the implementation uses `buf`. The trait is safe to implement,
    /// so it is possible that the code that's supposed to write to the buffer might also read
    /// from it. It is your responsibility to make sure that `buf` is initialized
    /// before calling `read`. Calling `read` with an uninitialized `buf` (of the kind one
    /// obtains via [`MaybeUninit<T>`]) is not safe, and can lead to undefined behavior.
